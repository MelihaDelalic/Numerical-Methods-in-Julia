# Numerical Methods in Julia 🤍💻

In this repository I demonstrate various numerical methods implemented in the Julia programming language.
### Main Categories:

- **Interpolation**: 
  - Lagrange Interpolation
  - Piecewise Interpolation
  - Quadratic Interpolation
- **Linear Algebra**: 
  - L-U Decomposition
  - Matrix operations (e.g., finding determinants)
  - Linear algebra exercises
- **Numerical Differentiation**: 
  - Forward Difference (First-order)
  - Central Difference (Second-order)
  - Backward Difference (First-order)
- **Root-Finding Methods**: 
  - Bisection Method
  - Newton's Method
  - Secant Method
 
### Features:
- Numerical methods are implemented and demonstrated with examples.
- Resulting plots for visualization are included to help understand the methods better.
  
### Installation: 🚀
To use the code, you can simply clone this repository and ensure you have the necessary dependencies in your Julia environment.
